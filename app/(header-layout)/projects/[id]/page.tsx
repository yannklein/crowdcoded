              SHO Farm is located in Yokosuka City an hour and an half by train
              from Tokyo. They grow delicious organic vegetables mostly from
              native seeds without any chemical (pesticide, herbicide or
              fertilizers). Their aim is to build sustainable agriculture in
              their family farm following the principle of permaculture, they
              preserve the soil by reducing tillage as much as possible, they
              try to be zero waste as much as possible and they prioritise local
              and fresh produce deliveries. They are also connected to their
              local community and organize enjoyable events and different type
              of business collaboration projects.

              about permaculture, we decided to spend a day helping them.{' '}

            Shoko and Shoâ€™s farm website has been around for quite sometimes and
            became cluttered and hard to maintain. They need a **website
            update** that will help them better sell their produce.
